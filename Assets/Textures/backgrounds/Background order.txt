order is:
background-ground
background-day (can repeat)
bacground-clouds (can repeat)
background-clouds-2 (can repeat)
background-clouds-3 (can repeat)
background-day-transition
bacground-night-transition
moon
background-space-transition
background-space, or background-space-2, or background-space-3 (should repeat)

then, with any of the space backgrounds in between:
mars
asteroid belt
jupiter
saturn
uranus
neptune
kuiper belt

Then just space, I guess

All can be resized before the final build, as they are quite high res.
